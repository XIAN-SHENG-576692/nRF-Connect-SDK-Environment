### üìÑ How to manually Install J-Link

1. Download the `JLink_Linux_x86_64.deb` from [SEGGER - The Embedded Experts - Downloads - J-Link / J-Trace](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)
2. Extract the package contents:
    ```bash
    dpkg-deb -R JLink_Linux_V862_x86_64.deb ./jlink_unpack
    ```
3. Move the extracted files and create a symbolic link:
    ```bash
    mv ./jlink_unpack/opt/SEGGER /opt/SEGGER
    ln -snf /opt/SEGGER/JLink_V862 /opt/SEGGER/JLink
    ```

### üìÑ How `nordic-semiconductor.nrf-connect` detects whether the SDK is installed

According to the [Welcome View](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-vscode/page/reference/ui_sidebar_welcome.html) and [Workspaces ‚Äî Zephyr Project Documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/west/workspaces.html#t2-star-topology-application-is-the-manifest-repository), the SDK must be installed in a directory structure that follows the T1, T2, or T3 workspace topology.

Only when the SDK is located within such a structure can the extension automatically detect and recognize it.

### üìÑ How to Access the `west` Environment in a Container

When the container is **launched through VS Code**, you **must** create a terminal using `nRF Connect: Create Shell Terminal`. This terminal includes the `west` environment automatically.

> **Note:** A regular VS Code terminal **does not** have `west` available.

When the container is **started directly using** `podman run`, all terminals inside the container **already include** `west` by default.
